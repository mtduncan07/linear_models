This is my first R Markdown document! 

Let's load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's plot some scatterplots of the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Build a simple linear model for the data, using Solar.R, Wind, and Temp as the predictors for Ozone:

```{r}
lm_ozone <- lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R + Wind + Temp + Month, data = airquality)
summary(lm_ozone)
```
